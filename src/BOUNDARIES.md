# Banking Module Boundaries

## Current Functionality
- Account creation (PARENT only)
- Authentication integration
- Role-based access control

## Module Boundaries

### Public API
1. Account Management
   - Create account (PARENT only)
   - View account details
   - List family accounts
   - Update account balance

2. Authentication & Authorization
   - Integrates with existing auth middleware
   - Role-based access control
   - User context handling

### Integration Points
1. Authentication System
   - Uses requireAuth middleware
   - Role validation (PARENT, CHILD)
   - User context in requests

2. Family System
   - Family relationships
   - Member access control
   - Family-wide account views

3. Event System
   - Account creation events
   - Balance update events
   - Transaction events

## Data Boundaries
1. Account Data
   - Basic account information
   - Balance tracking
   - Family relationship
   - Owner information

2. Transaction Data
   - Transaction records
   - Balance updates
   - Audit trail

## Security Boundaries
1. Access Control
   - PARENT role for account creation
   - Account owner access
   - Family member access

2. Data Validation
   - Input validation
   - Balance validation
   - Transaction validation

## Module Dependencies
1. Required
   - Authentication module
   - Family module
   - Event system

2. Optional
   - Notification system
   - Audit logging

## Migration Strategy
1. Phase 1: Core Account Management
   - Move existing account creation
   - Preserve role-based access
   - Add basic account operations

2. Phase 2: Data Layer
   - Implement repository pattern
   - Add transaction support
   - Ensure data consistency

3. Phase 3: Integration
   - Event system integration
   - Enhanced authorization
   - Family system integration

## Success Criteria
1. Functionality
   - All existing features work
   - Role-based access maintained
   - Data consistency preserved

2. Integration
   - Clean module boundaries
   - Proper event handling
   - Type-safe interfaces

3. Testing
   - Unit tests pass
   - Integration tests pass
   - Role validation works
