# Banking Module Migration Plan

## Current System Analysis
- Account Management (Core)
  - Create accounts (parent only)
  - View account details
  - List family accounts
  
- Transaction Management
  - Request transactions
  - Approve/reject transactions (parent only)
  - View transaction details
  
- Loan Management
  - Request loans
  - Approve loans (parent only)
  - Make loan payments
  
- Marketplace
  - Create/update listings
  - View listings
  - Purchase items
  - Approve purchases (parent only)

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Account Management (Core)
1. Create basic module structure
   - Domain models
   - Interfaces
   - Repository layer
   - Service layer
   - Controller layer

2. Migrate Account functionality
   - Move existing account logic
   - Add domain validation
   - Implement repository pattern
   - Update controllers to use new structure

3. Validation Steps
   - Ensure all account tests pass
   - Verify role-based access
   - Test account operations

### Phase 2: Transaction Management
1. Add transaction support
   - Transaction domain model
   - Transaction repository
   - Approval workflow
   - Event handling

2. Migration Steps
   - Move transaction logic
   - Implement approval system
   - Update controllers
   - Add transaction validation

### Phase 3: Loan Management
1. Implement loan functionality
   - Loan domain model
   - Loan repository
   - Payment processing
   - Approval system

2. Migration Steps
   - Move loan logic
   - Add payment handling
   - Update controllers
   - Implement validation

### Phase 4: Marketplace
1. Add marketplace features
   - Listing management
   - Purchase workflow
   - Approval system

2. Migration Steps
   - Move marketplace logic
   - Implement purchase flow
   - Add listing management
   - Update controllers

## Validation Strategy
1. Each phase must:
   - Pass all existing tests
   - Maintain current functionality
   - Follow new module patterns
   - Handle errors properly

2. Integration points:
   - Verify auth middleware
   - Check role-based access
   - Test error scenarios
   - Validate business rules

## Rollback Plan
1. Each phase has a rollback point
2. Keep old implementation until phase is validated
3. Use feature flags for gradual rollout
4. Maintain backward compatibility

## Dependencies
- Authentication system
- Role management
- Family relationships
- Event system
- Database access

## Success Criteria
1. All existing functionality preserved
2. Improved code organization
3. Better error handling
4. Clear module boundaries
5. Type safety throughout
6. Comprehensive testing
7. Documentation updated
